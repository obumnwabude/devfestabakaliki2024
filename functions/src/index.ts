// These 2 functions should not enter production or be available to the public.
// They are only here to grant access to requestees but through the firebase
// emulator that is running locally but with production auth.
//
// To use them, uncomment them, then run the following command
//
// firebase emulators:start --only functions
//
// Then visit the adminPendingAccess link that the emulator will give you in a
// browser and see those pending. Copy the uid of a user and paste as a
// URL query parameter to adminGrantAccess link. Equally add a nickname for the
// admin you want to add. That is, add
// ?uid=uid-you-copied&nickname=single-no-space-nickname
// to the end of the second adminGrantAccess link that the emulator gave you and
// send the request. uid and nickname are compulsory, else the call will fail.
// After sending successfully, you would have made the user an admin.
//
// Be sure to comment them back when then done. Please don't leave them
// uncommented in git history. Also, don't leave them uncommented when
// running firebase deploy ðŸ¤²ðŸ¤²ðŸ¤².

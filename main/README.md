# DevFest Abakaliki 2024 - Main

This directory contains a React + TypeScript + Vite frontend for the main publicly-available [devfestabakaliki.com](https://devfestabakaliki.com).

It displays the landing page with Countdown, last year's DevFest's photos, speakers, and sponsors. 

The Register page contains a form where anyone can fill in details and purchase a ticket. 

It interacts with Cloud Functions to complete the payment redirection flow with PayStack.

Special thanks to [Ebube Chukwuma](https://github.com/chukwuma619) for his immerse support in building the UI.
